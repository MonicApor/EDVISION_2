# EDVISION: School Management System

#Abstract

  Edvision is a school management system that seeks to tackle this problem by making enrolment easier and more systematic, as well as automatically processing everything that needs to be computed. The programmers devised a system to aid teachers and students with their work. This technology also does automated sectioning and filters student data. Students are identified by their student profile, which is kept on file at the registrar's office. Students would have a more user-friendly experience with this system, making their processes easier. Faculty members would gain the most because the system would relieve a significant portion of each teacher's workload. Because a school management system will help more people at Paknaan Elementary School, the developers could anticipate fewer employees being burnt out at work.
